# GDP_Analysis_Dashboard

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the Gross Domestic Product(GDP) performance of Nigeria from 2020-2022. By analyzing the real GDP of this dataset, we seek to identify trends over time, Quarter on Quarter, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the Nigeria's economy and performances. 

### Data Sources

GDP Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "GDP_data_raw" file, containing detailed information about each GDP of Nigeria from 2020-2022.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](www.office.com)
- Power BI - Data Visualization [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)

### In the Initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Removing irrelevant cells and colours
3. Handling missing and duplicate values
4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved in exploring the GDP data to answer key questions, such as:

1. What is the Q1 2022 Real GDP?
2. What is the QoQ(This Quarter vs Last Quarter)?
3. This Quarter vs same Quarter last year?
4. What is the quarterly trend of GDP
5. The percentage change in Real GDP preceding quarter?
6. Top 10 Real GDP by activity sector?

### Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Real Gross Domestic Product(GDP), decreased at an annual rate of -14.66%, in Q1, 2022 following and increase of 9.63% in the preceding quarter. 
- Against the same quarter last year, Real GDP was higher by 3.11%.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- The Federal government should invest, support, and push more funds to the agricultural sector since it is the leading activity sector as this will enhance the GDP in that sector.
- The Federal government should explore more in the mining and quarrying sector as there are many untapped natural resources in the country which when properly mined will boost the GDP.
- There is scarcity of houses across the country, the Federal government should support private realtors and partner with them to solve the house scarcity problem and make more money out if it. 

### Limitations

I removed all the Totals in the dataset because they would have altered the accuracy of my analysis and also, i can easily calculate it using  DAX measures. I also created date table for time intelligent functions and accuracy of the outcome.
